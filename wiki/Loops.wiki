#summary Documentation of control loop blocks for translators and users.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction and Terminology =

The *Control* category holds blocks that control whether other blocks placed in their *body* is run.  There are two types of control blocks: IfElse (described on their own page) and these, which control how many times the body is run and, in some cases, the value of a variable used within the body.  These structures are called *loops* since the body is repeated (possibly) multiple times, reminiscent of a rope containing loops.    Each pass through the loop is called an *iteration*.  (How about our using the term "pass"?)  For more information, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops].

= Blocks =

== Repeat ==

The simplest "repeat" block runs the code in its body the specified number of times.  For example, the following block will print "Hello!" ten times.

=== Repeat-while ===

Imagine a game in which a player rolls a die and adds up all of the values rolled as long as the total is less than 30.  The following blocks implement that game:

 # A variable named *total* gets an initial value of 0.
 # The loop begins with a check that *total* is less than 30.  If so, the blocks in the body are run.
 # A random number in the range 1 to 6 is generated (simulating a die roll) and stored in a variable named *roll*.
 # The number rolled is printed.
 # The variable *total* gets increased by *roll*.
 # The end of the loop having been reached, control goes back to step 2.

When the loop completes, any subsequent blocks (not shown) would be run.  In our example, the loop would end after some number of random numbers in the range 1 to 6 had been printed, and the variable *total* would hold the sum of these numbers, which would be guaranteed to be at least 30.

For more information, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop].

=== Repeat-until ===

Repeat-while loops repeat their bodies _while_ some condition is true.  Repeat-until loops are similar except that they repeat their bodies _until_ some condition is true.  The following blocks are equivalent to the previous example because the loop contains until *total* is greater than or equal to 30.
