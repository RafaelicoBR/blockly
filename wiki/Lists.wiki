#summary Description of Blockly "list" blocks for translators and users

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

As in everyday speech, a Blockly list is an ordered collection of items, such as a "to do" list or a shopping list.  Items in a list may be of any type, and the same value may appear more than once in a list.

= List creation =

== create empty list ==

The simplest list is the empty list, which is created with the *create empty list* block:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-create-empty-list.png

== create list with ==

The *create list with* block allows the user to specify the initial values in a new list.  In this example, a list of words is being created and placed in a variable named *letters*:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-create-list-with-text.png

For this document, we'll denote this list as ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"], and we will refer below to the variables defined in this section.

This shows the creation of a list of numbers:

This creates a list of colours:

It is less common, but possible, to create a list with values of different types:

== create list with item ==

The *create list with item* block lets you create a list that has the specified number of copies of an item.  For example, the following blocks set the variable *words* to the list containing ["very", "very", "very"].

= Checking a List's Length =

== is empty ==

The value of an *is empty* block is *true* if its input is the empty list and *false* if it is anything else (including a non-list).  IS THIS TRUE?  The value of the following blocks would be *false* because the variable *colours* is not empty: it has three items.

Note the similarity to the [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Text#Checking_for_empty_text "is empty" block for text].

== length of ==

The value of the *length of* block is the number of elements in the list used as an input.  For example, the value of the following blocks would be 3 because colour has three items.

Note that the *length of* block tells you how many items are in the list, not how many _different_ items are in it.  For example, the following has the value 3, even though *words* consists of three copies of the same text (["very", "very", "very"]).

Note the similarity to the [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Text#Text_length "length of" block for text].

= Finding Items in a List =

These blocks find the position of an item in a list.  For example, the following has a value of 1 because the first appearance of "very" is as the beginning of the *words* list (["very", "very", "very"]).

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-find-first1.png

The result of the following is 3 because the last appearance of "very" in *words* is in position 3.

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-find-last.png

If the item is nowhere in the list, the result is in the value 0, as in this example:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-find-first2.png

These blocks are analogous to [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Text#Finding_text the ones for finding letters in text].

= Getting Items from a List =

Recall the definition of the list *colours*:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-create-list-with-colours.png

The following block gets the color <font color="blue">blue</font> because it is the second element in the list (counting from the beginning on the left):

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-in-list-get1.png

This gets <font color="green">green</font> because it is the first element counting from the end (right):

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-in-list-get2.png

This gets the first element, <font color="red">red</font>:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-in-list-get3.png

This gets the last element, <font color="green">green</font>:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/list-in-list-get4.png

This randomly selects an item from the list, returning any of <font color="red">red</font>, <font color="blue">blue</font>, or <font color="green">green</font> with equal likelihood.
